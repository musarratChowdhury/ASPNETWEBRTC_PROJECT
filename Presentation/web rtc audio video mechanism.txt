The main task of the audio mechanism is to handle
echo cancellation and noise reduction. Echo cancellation
is a method that improves the sound quality, removing the
resulting echo or preventing its occurrence. Noise
reduction is the process of removing noise from the signal.
The audio mechanism contains iSAC and iLBC codecs.
iSAC codec represents a wideband audio codec developed
by Global IP Solutions. This codec is suitable for audio
streams and in June 2011 became a part of the WebRTC
technology. Global IP Solutions is also the creator of the
iLBC codec. This narrowband audio codec is suitable for
voice communication over IP.


The video mechanism is responsible for image
enhancement and video jitter buffer. Image enhancement
is the process of improving the quality of digital image by
manipulation with a certain software. The video
mechanism includes VP8 codec. VP8 codec is a video
compression format. It was developed by On2
Technologies in September 2008 and is currently
supported by Chrome, Mozilla and Opera.
